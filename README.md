# DYOR resources

Links to online resources for you to DYOR. 

## Objective

Collect and curate a list of publicly accessible resources, so you can **do your own research**,
inform yourself and others about current events, and learn about the history that led to where we
are today. By becoming incrementally wiser day-by-day, we can in-turn help our peers, families,
and communities to become wiser too. Life is absolutely a team sport, and weâ€™re all on the same team.
